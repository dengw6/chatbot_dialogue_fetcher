The next project is to build a chatbot. I did not have any experience of making this kind of work. I had to say it was quite a difficult task.

Robert and me stayed in the same group. Two girls, Jihane and Violeta joined the group. Joe (pa pa) came in as well, so there were 5 of all.

In our first meeting in the ECB building, I realised this group was not the same as previous one, and the project was not the same as the mbot either. Unlike the first project, chatbot asked us to set it up with code, not visualised blocks. With a sense of unease, our group came up with a dull (in my perspective) idea: to build a currency bot, which provide the information about up to date currency rates, differences between currencies, draw graphs of currency changes and communicate with users. Boring as it seemed, the difficulty was still out of my expectation.

Since we were sort of wondering in first week, (but to be frank we are wondering throughout the time) we did our research separately. I started to handle with the random dialogue fetcher of our chatbot using dictionary with importing random. I was the easiest one of all my work. I finished the work in one of our meeting.
